                        <p class="history"> <span class="material-icons">history</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>Apr 4, 2022</span> </p>
                        <p class="blog-text"> Gone are the days when phones were mostly used to make calls or to send short text snippets. Today, they have so many functionalities that it’s hard to pinpoint one. If we really had to, we could say that today’s smartphones are essentially tracking devices. They log your location, your browsing habits, your movements, your keypad inputs and much more.</p>
                        <p class="blog-text">Installed apps try sending this information to advertisers for marketing purposes; the operating system itself also collects a lot of data which sends to developers. App tracking has been under the spotlight for a while (especially since Apple unveiled its App Tracking Transparency feature), but what about all the data collected by the OS? A recent study on six different types of handsets found that, even when idle, most of them transmitted “substantial amounts” of information to the OS developer and third parties such as Google, Microsoft, LinkedIn and Facebook.</p>
                        <p class="blog-text">It’s clear that, to some extent, sending data over the Internet is part of how connected devices work: it was the amount of information transmitted that surprised researchers. So, what can you do? It’s not easy to break free from the Google-Apple duopoly, but if you are a privacy-obsessed person, you might consider installing a different operating system.</p>
                        <p class="blog-text">There are many good candidates out there, but in my experience Ubuntu Touch and GrapheneOS are perhaps the best choices in terms of ease of installation, usability and support.</p>
                        <h1 class="blog-text">Ubuntu Touch</h1>
                        <p class="blog-text">If you search for Ubuntu Touch on Google, you still get a lot of results related to when the OS was developed by Canonical, the company that publishes and promotes Ubuntu. That was almost ten years ago. Since then, the job has been taken over by UBPorts, a non-profit foundation.</p>
                        <p class="blog-text">The number of supported devices has grown: you can now run the OS on relatively recent devices such as the Google Pixel 3a, the Xiaomi Redmi Note 9 Pro, the One Plus 6T. Installation is quite fast: just enable USB debugging on your smartphone, unlock the bootloader, download the UBPorts installer from their website, plug your device in and follow instructions.</p>
                        <p class="blog-text">I tried Ubuntu Touch on three devices: LG Nexus 5, OnePlus One, Sony Xperia X. It all went off without a hitch. At first, I was impressed by how usable it all was, how natural the interaction with the device felt. Gestures are slightly different from those you make on Android and iPhones and there are no buttons to tap at the bottom.</p>
                        <p class="blog-text">You simply use a sidebar that sits on the left of the screen. You tap to launch the main applications, or swipe right to show all the installed apps. Calls worked fine and it was possible to do all the main things you normally do on a daily basis: exchange emails, chat or browse the Web.</p>
                        <p class="blog-text">It’s basically a de-Googled experience. You don’t need to log in to a Google account to install apps; instead of the Play Store, you get the Open Store, which requires no registration. Alas, the number of apps on the latter is very limited and some of the essential ones, like Dekko for emailing or Telegram’s clone Teleports, do their job but miss some of the functionalities of native clients.</p>
                        <p class="blog-text">Another downside of using Ubuntu Touch is that you might not be able to take pictures as good as those that you could shoot on Android or iOS. First of all, UT does not work on the latest top-range smartphones, with their stellar camera equipment. Secondly, the camera software itself is not on par with its proprietary competitors (on the Pixels, for instance, the AI software greatly enhances the performance).</p>
                        <p class="blog-text">Ubuntu Touch is open source: everyone can access the code and check that are no backdoors or privacy-killing apps. This should make it safer than Android or iOS. In theory, at least. The recent Log4j mess has cast some doubts on the security of open-source software.</p>
                        <p class="blog-text">All in all, Ubuntu Touch is a good operating system, more mature than one might think. Would I use a UT device as my daily driver? Only if apps scarcity and the quality of pictures are not my primary concerns. As things stand, I see it more as a good backup option.</p>
